# Random-Forest-Example
I developed a project using heart disease data and applied a Random Forest classifier with hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.GridSearchCV was utilized to optimize hyperparameters such as the number of trees, maximum depth, and minimum samples split, achieving a robust, accurate model.
